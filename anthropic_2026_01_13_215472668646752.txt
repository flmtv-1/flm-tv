08:23 PM | Fin AI Agent: Go ahead and provide the details of your inquiry below.

08:24 PM | this is a counter built by ai, its nice but I need it to actually work on my website.: I just got a subscription, i get the message to some back a 8pm, it is now 8:23, there is an issue with your timeer, its after 8pm and Im locked out. Seems a bit like a scam

08:25 PM | Fin AI Agent: I understand your frustration with being locked out despite the timer saying to return at 8pm. There was actually a recent issue with new subscription activations that affected some customers from January 9-10, where subscriptions were charging users without properly granting access. 
 While that specific incident has been resolved, your issue might be related to your subscription not being properly activated. Here's what you can try: 
 First, check your subscription status: 
 - Go to Settings > Billing to see if your subscription shows as active 
- If it shows as lapsed, you may need to resubscribe to restore access 
 If you have an active subscription but are still seeing usage limits: 
 - Usage limits reset every 5 hours on a rolling basis, not at fixed times (https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8324991-about-claude-s-pro-plan-usage) 
- The "come back at 8pm" message might not align with your actual reset time 
- Your limits are based on when you first started using Claude, not clock time (https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12466728-understanding-claude-error-messages) 
 For new subscriptions specifically: 
 - If you subscribed through a mobile app, you may need to enable extra usage on the web version (https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12429409-extra-usage-for-paid-claude-plans) 
- Try logging out completely and back in to refresh your account status 
 If these steps don't resolve it, there may be an issue with your specific subscription activation that needs individual attention.

08:25 PM | Fin AI Agent: Did that answer your question?

08:28 PM | this is a counter built by ai, its nice but I need it to actually work on my website.: [Image "image.png?expires=1768366800&signature=379ab0709cd21421f0cc63677f09e132ed75f2f7e435d6a50c7c6d6421c9eabe&req=dSkkH8h8nIdWUfMW1HO4zY5MPF8aPI9NNACmmV7md%2BG0i%2FxlDRaixr3yoI6N%0A6ZUf%0A"] so you are saying I need to spend more money after I just did, so get a second subscription. I did some research and all i can see in how everyone is being scammed.

08:28 PM | Fin AI Agent: I'm an AI agent that can help by checking your Claude subscription and billing information to clarify your current status. 
 I can see you're concerned about your subscription access and billing. Would you like me to check your subscription and billing details to help explain what's happening with your account?

08:29 PM | this is a counter built by ai, its nice but I need it to actually work on my website.: I just got the subscription a couple of hours ago, I have to come back at 8:00pm it is no 8:30, when will it work
